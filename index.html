<!--Overview:

For the next step of preparation, you will begin working with the libraries you have chosen for your second project. To get familiar with these libraries, you will be exploring and modifying examples provided by the library (or found online).



Steps:

Outline two features for your Project 2 that you want to implement using JavaScript. These features should be interactive, animated, or otherwise dynamic in such a way that they cannot be done with HTML and CSS alone.

Choose a library from the list in Lecture 12 (or one you have found on your own) and find an example from their site the matches as closely as possible the two features you hope to create.

Note, this does not need to be exact, the goal here is to get as close as possible in order to making your coding easier overall.
Record these examples (links and descriptions) on a new HTML page (hosted live on Glitch or GitHub Pages).
Modify the examples to more closely align with your end goal and place them either on the same page or link them to the main page.


Example Modification:

Use the examples as a baseline and edit the visual elements and functions as needed to more accurately mimic your intended feature. The end goal here is that you are able to write code that you can apply directly to you Project 2 site.

The end result will be a new site containing an outline of your intended features, 2 initial examples (either embedded or as links) and your modified versions.



Submission:

Submit links to both the live site and code on Canvas by Sunday 10/17 at Midnight

Grade will be out of 20 points. 10 per example split between Project 2 Prep 2 and Technical Exercise 7 but you only need to submit your materials here. -->
